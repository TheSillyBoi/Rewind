# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS











*This work was assisted using the use of Artificial Intelligence Models, specifically Claude Sonnet 4.0*

> The end goal is to make it so there can be child reminders, so if there's two reminders that are both connected, one can be a child reminder of the other, so if I have to, for example, pick up groceries after work, if I say I left work early, it'll remind me to go to the grocery store earlier, or If I need to water my plants once a week, and I'm late a day, it'll move a day forward so it'll continue to be every 7 days*
